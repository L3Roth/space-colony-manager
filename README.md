A good way to learn NgRx, RxJS and Nx

Game objective:
The player builds a colony on an alien planet, manages resources (energy, food, water), constructs buildings and must master random events (storms, alien attacks, resource scarcity).

  Core mechanics
    Resource management:
      Food, energy, water and oxygen must be managed.
      Buildings consume resources and generate new ones.

    Building system:
      Living quarters, farms, solar power plants, water treatment, research labs, etc.
      Buildings can be constructed and improved.

    Events & challenges:
      Meteorites, sandstorms, alien attacks or technical defects provide excitement.

    Colonist management:
      Each unit has needs (food, sleep, work).
      Morale and efficiency influence productivity.
      
    Tech tree & progress:
      Unlock technologies to enable new buildings & upgrades.
